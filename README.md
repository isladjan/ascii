# ASCII Effect

An ASCII effect for THREE.js and post-processing (using vanilla THREE.js).

Take a peek at [demo1](https://isladjan.com/works/ascii1/) and [demo2](https://isladjan.com/works/ascii2/)

The three/examples/jsm library also includes an ASCII effect, but I would recommend avoiding it because itâ€™s too slow and likely not intended for production use.

This effect is based on the work of [cieplak/AsciiEffect.js](https://gist.github.com/cieplak/0f1f615b0f245cccbea34c15d8d09cb6) and [emilwidlund/ASCII](https://github.com/emilwidlund/ASCII)

# How to use
Grab ascii.js or the minified version and set it up according to the example in index.html.

import { EffectComposer, RenderPass, EffectPass } from "postprocessing";
import { ASCIIEffect } from './asciiEffect.min.js' 

const asciiEffect = new ASCIIEffect({ 
    fontSize: 35, 
    cellSize: 16,
    invert: false, 
    color: "#ffffff", 
    characters: ` .:,'-^=*+?!|0#X%WM@`
});

composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);
